# Poker Hand Sorter

This is command line program that takes, via STDIN, a "stream" of hands for a two player poker game. At the completion of the stream, it prints to STDOUT the number of hands won by Player 1, and the number of hands won by Player 2.

**Note: Validation was not handled since it was assumed that this application would always get valid STDIN.**
